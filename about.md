# Hello, again

I'm Brian Ryer and if you're looking for my professional site, you've found it.

This site is meant to serve mostly as a place to let people know about my services; it's also a little bit for my own diversion and, perhaps, your's as well. 

I live with my family in the Pacific Northwest – Portland, Oregon specifically – where we enjoy as many of the things the area has to offer that time, resources and inclination allow. It is a beautiful part of the country, both in the natural surroundings and in the kind of people that have been drawn to it over the years. Viva Cascadia!

I didn't always live here.

I was born in New York, grew up in Las Vegas, spent my teen years in Southern California, lived in Europe for about 20 years, then briefly in Texas, before putting down roots in Stumptown. Whew! 

I hope you take away something useful from what you find presented here.
