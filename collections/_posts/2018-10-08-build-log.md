Keeping track of what I’m doing as I build my website in Jekyll/Liquid, hosted on fitHub for nuthin’!
I’m liking it a lot so far.
I’ve factored out a quick version, well, three quick versions of my resume without any fuss, and I can see how to further reduce the complexity of the markup and present the content more flexibly, BUT I thought I really must get the blog working first.
